### ```Shellcheck```
- [Shellcheck](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/joK6l_yEZ9N7T0GQ1RDjLA) is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts. It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and - provide advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about. `Shellcheck` is your friend! All your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error or you will not get any points on the task.

- `Shellcheck` is available on the schoolâ€™s computers. If you want to use it on your own computer, here is how to install [it](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/jbz0_-i3TV3WpKgxhyrtpA).


- For every feedback, `Shellcheck` will provide a code that you can use to get more information about the issue, for example for code SC2034, you can [browse]( https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2034)
